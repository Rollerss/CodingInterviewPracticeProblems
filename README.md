# Coding Interview Practice Problems

This repository contains my solutions to some common coding interview practice problems. My first solution may not be the most optimal but it should pass all tests.

The coding problems come from this [Notion](https://www.notion.so/de7d8005cd3749b2a1c5f995b4a92bba?v=00b004e1ba144d84a7f207cd30d2fa0d) 

The Notion was created by [Engineering with Utsav](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4HiUdMwzyZhBUoNKXenO-A) 

Here is video that inspired me to create this repository [How to Prepare for Technical Interviews, Part 1 - Coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UlslIXHNsw&t=4s)


# The goal of this repository 
 1. Have my solution to some coding interview problem in the Notion
 2. The solution should pass all test cases
 3. Later I plan to create optimized the solutions
